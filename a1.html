            <p>
            I am currently a student at VIT university pursuing B.Tech in Information Technology.I like to code and play sports like cricket and table tennis.
            <br>
            <br>
            I believe that the discipline and perseverance required to excel in sports are equally applicable to the world of technology.
             My goal is to leverage my passion for technology and sports to pursue a career in the field of software development, where I can apply my problem-solving skills and creativity to build innovative solutions that make a positive impact on people's lives.
            I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow, so feel free to connect with me and learn more about my experiences and aspirations.</p>
